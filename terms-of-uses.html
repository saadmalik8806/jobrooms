            <h2><strong>9. Refunds</strong></h2>
<p>Service fees are non-refundable; however Jobrooms will review each request subjectively and will reserve the right to issue or deny a refund. If you received a faulty, damaged, or simply not the right product, email info@xyz.com as soon as you receive it and include pictures to support your description. You can still return the product to us and we will endeavour to repair or replace it. If we cannot offer a repair/replacement, we will process a refund. All products must be returned unused, in the original packaging with intact tags. Incomplete, torn, worn, soiled or anything we may believe has been used will not be accepted.

<h2><strong>10. Billing disputes</strong></h2>
<p>Each customer agrees to provide Jobrooms 30 days to attempt settlement of any billing dispute before disputing with any third-party credit/debit card company or bank. Should the company receive a chargeback from a third-party credit/debit card company or bank on the customer’s behalf before it has been given a chance to resolve the issue, the company has the right to charge the customer for its time spent in resolving such disputes and any associated fees incurred by the company. Regardless of the outcome of the chargeback, the company retains the right to collect any services or fees that are due. Jobrooms may submit any disputed amounts to a collection agency. Once a chargeback has been received, the company has the right to suspend the account until the matter is resolved.</p>

<h2><strong>11. Governing law and jurisdiction</strong></h2>
